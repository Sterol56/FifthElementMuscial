# FifthElementMuscial
FifthElementMuscial is a music beats games that comes from the movie the Fifth Element. When a song is playing, the FifthElement in the center would change its color due to the music beats of the song. That's the element you need to shoot to the center to make the FifthElement to save our planet. The player press the w/s/a/d key on the keyboard to shoot elements of a certain color to the center Fifth Element with the same color. If color matches when the large element and the shooting element collides, the right beats are played. Otherwise terrible noise would be played and players lose points and break their hits. As their hits keep climbing, the game become harder and more effects are added to the game.You would also get more score as game become harder. There're are different finales due to your final score. I hope you guys would love it!
