FifthElementMuscial is a music video games that comes from the movie the Fifth Element. When a song is playing, there're some parts(beats) missing in the music. The biggest circle in the middle would change it's color when the song is playing. The player press the w/s/a/d key on the keyboard to shoot elements of a certain color to the center Fifth Element with the same color. If color matches when the large element and the shooting element collides, the right beats are played. Otherwise terrible noise would be played and players lose points and break their hits. As their hits keep climbing, the game became harder and more effects are added to the game. The four element might rotate and the sound effect would change.
